<h1>Generative Models</h1>

Generative Adversarial Networks have been first introduced in 2014 in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf">this paper</a>. It provides a general framework to train and use generative models. Then, it has been applied to image generation in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf">this paper</a>.

In this post, we analyze the results obtained with state-of-the-art GANs estimated by Karras et al.:
<ul>
 <li>Progressive Growing GANs (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196">here</a>)</li>
 <li>StyleGan2 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958">here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Image generation</h2>

We give here images generated by those models for different tasks.

<script>

    // Paths for each input types

    
    function updateImage() {
        // Get selector value
        var select_value = document.getElementById("random_images_select").selectedOptions[0].value;
        var slider_value = document.getElementById("random_images_range").value;

        console.log(select_value);
        console.log(slider_value);

        // Change image
        var x = document.getElementById("random_image");
        x.setAttribute("src", "stylegan2/outputs/face/random/images/" + (slider_value-1) + ".png");
    }
</script>

<div class="random_images">

    <div>
        <select id="random_images_select" onchange="updateImage()">
            <option>Faces</option>
            <option>Cars</option>
            <option>Churches</option>
            <option>Horses</option>
            <option>Living Rooms</option>
        </select>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img id="random_image" src="stylegan2/outputs/face/random/images/0.png" alt="" width="300" height="300">
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="range" min="1" max="30" value="1" class="slider" id="random_images_range" oninput="updateImage()">
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

GANs didn't bring many applications until now. The main reason is that they are known to be very hard to train because optimizing the generator and the discriminator at the same time.

However, recent breakthroughs in GANs estimation, and in particular for images generation enable to produce very realistic images of everything you want, as long as you have enough training data.
A key feature is also that you don't need that much images in your training dataset - a few thousands are enough.

We think that they can help in many fields - architecture, product and web design, ....
